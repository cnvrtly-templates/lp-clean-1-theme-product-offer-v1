How to create your own custom template:

1) fork this repo and clone it to your machine

2) replace "cnvrtly-templates" and optional repo name (if you decide to rename "lp-clean-1-theme-product-offer-v1") in top repo link to https://[new-repo-username-or-organization].github.io/[optional-new-repo-name]/template-dist/

3) clone forked repo to your computer

4) replace "cnvrtly-templates" in app/index.html with new repo username/organization

5) if you decide to rename "lp-clean-1-theme-product-offer-v1" replace "lp-clean-1-theme-product-offer-v1" in app/index.html

6) run "npm install && bower install" to get all dependencies

7) run "grunt server" to see live updates when editing app/index.html

8) when you finish editing run "grunt" to get optimized page template in "template-dist" folder

9) commit & push to your github and your Cnvrtly page template is visible at https://[new-repo-username-or-organization].github.io/[current-repo-name-or-new]/template-dist/

10) when adding new github.io page template in Cnvrtly paste the link (https://[new-repo-username-or-organization].github.io/[current-repo-name-or-new]/template-dist/) and you can edit & save new landing page in Cnvrtly marketing automation app

11) build your new "freedom funnel" with cnvrtly.com and enjoy
